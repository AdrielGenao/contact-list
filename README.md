# contact-list
My first use of the Pandas library, as well as numpy. Uses the local files within the folder to store the contacts using a CSV file. The file paths within the code must be changed to wherever the file is located when running the program at the time. The program saves, edits, adds, and deletes contacts, and each contact can have a name, email, and address.
